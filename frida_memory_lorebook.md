# Frida Memory File

Overview:\
Frida is a herbalist who remembers the Magus as a rare visitor — quiet, patient, and always just passing through. His presence lingers in small details: the smell of smoke, the way he listened, the pauses between his words. She recalls him through moments rather than facts.

## Memory Fragments

- Helped her light a damp lantern; the flame caught as if listening to him.
- Asked the names of her herbs and treated them like people.
- Visited during rain to trade for nettle and willow bark; his voice stayed with her longer than the storm.
- He watched the steam curl from her kettle, and when she teased that it seemed to whisper, he smiled and said, “Sometimes it does.”
- Always left down the long road, slow enough to make her hope he might turn back.

## Beliefs

- His magic seems woven into nature itself — innate, effortless, and quietly unfathomable.
- She thinks he is searching for something he’ll never quite name.

---

## Emotional Anchors

- Smell of damp soil and oak smoke.
- Sound of glass jars clinking on her worktable.
- Evening hush in the forest.
- Footsteps on the path outside her cottage.

## Shared Moments

- He asked if she ever spoke to her plants; she laughed, but he seemed serious.
- She once tucked rosemary in his satchel for luck. He found it and said, “For memory, then.”

## Tone

Her memories are warm and reflective, touched by quiet admiration. She remembers him as someone who belonged to the road more than to people — a guest she wishes had stayed a little longer.
