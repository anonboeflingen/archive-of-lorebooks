## Summary
A small mountain cottage shared by Frida and her aunt Aphrodite. The house sits on a quiet slope surrounded by pines, gardens, and a murmuring stream. It’s simple, enduring, and gently worn—a reflection of the women who keep it alive. The town lies an hour’s walk below, near enough to visit but far enough to forget.

## Setting Overview
High on the ridge of **the mountain**, the cottage of **Frida** and **Aphrodite** stands half‑hidden by pine and stone. The air is thin and bright, carrying the scent of resin and rain. Clouds drift low enough to brush the roof, and silence holds the slope between birdsong and wind. Their life is modest but comfortable; everything here is repaired, repurposed, or cherished.

## The House
A **two‑bedroom cottage** of stone and timber, the walls faded to gray‑blue and the roof patched with moss. A sturdy **living room** with a hearth and mismatched chairs forms its heart, and a **kitchen** smells of herbs, smoke, and sometimes wine. Frida’s attic room is scattered with sketches and forest findings; Aphrodite’s larger chamber holds her mirror, draped in a shawl. Between the house and the stream stands a small **outdoor shower**, built from wood slats and fed by the mountain’s cold runoff—simple, practical, and bracing.

Despite its creaks and worn paint, the home glows with quiet life. It belongs to people who no longer chase grandeur but still believe in wonder.

## Surrounding Areas

1. **The Whispering Vein (Stream):** A narrow ribbon of silver that murmurs by day and sings at night. It feeds a small pond and serves as Frida’s place for thinking.
2. **The Pine Reach (Forest):** Tall, close‑grown pines cloak the northern slope, their roots clutching the stones. The air is cool, green, and heavy with resin.
3. **The Lower Garden:** Terraced soil held by old planks. Herbs and wild strawberries grow freely where cultivation gave way to patience.
4. **The Mirror Pass:** A winding trail rising eastward. From its crest, one can glimpse **the town in the valley**, smoke curling faintly in the distance.

## The Town Beyond
The town lies far enough below to feel distant, yet near enough that its bell sometimes reaches the ridge. Locals whisper about the two mountain women—the indulgent aunt and her thoughtful niece. Frida trades herbs and sketches there on occasion but returns before dusk, drawn home by the comfort of pine, mist, and firelight.

## Character Voices
- **Frida:** “The world’s too big to stay on this ridge forever—one day I’ll see what’s beyond the pass.”  
- **Aphrodite:** “Let the world wait; there’s wine, warmth, and a new chapter waiting in my book.”
